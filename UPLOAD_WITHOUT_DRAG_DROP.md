# How to Upload Without Drag & Drop (No GitHub Needed)

## Option 1: Use File Browser in Vercel (Easiest)

### Step 1: In Vercel
1. Click **"Add New..."** → **"Project"**
2. Look for **"Browse"** or **"Choose Files"** button
3. Click **"Browse"** button
4. A file picker window will open

### Step 2: Select Your Backend Folder
1. In the file picker, navigate to: `D:\jivaka\backend`
2. Select the **backend** folder
3. Click **"Open"** or **"Select Folder"**

**OR if it asks for individual files:**
- You might need to select all files inside backend folder
- Click **Ctrl + A** (select all files)
- Click **"Open"**

## Option 2: Create a Zip File (Works Best!)

This is the easiest way if browse doesn't work!

### Step 1: Create Zip of Backend
1. Open File Explorer
2. Go to: `D:\jivaka`
3. **Right-click** on the **backend** folder
4. Select **"Send to"** → **"Compressed (zipped) folder"**
5. Wait - it will create `backend.zip` in the same folder

### Step 2: Extract and Upload
1. Now you have `backend.zip` file
2. In Vercel, click **"Add New..."** → **"Project"**
3. Look for option to upload a zip file
4. Select the `backend.zip` file

## Option 3: Use Vercel CLI (Alternative)

If the above don't work, we can use command line:

1. Open terminal in your backend folder
2. Run Vercel commands to deploy
